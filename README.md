Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/pidsimulator

This PID simulator was forked from https://github.com/chokveen/pidSimulation

Here i modify the code to plot using QWT so hopefully it can be run on window/linux/mac

Tested on latest Qt-5.4 , qwt-6.1.2 and ubuntu 12.04 LTS

if you have problem feel free to contact me
